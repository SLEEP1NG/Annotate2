Java Annotate
=============

This is a simple Java-based program that allows annotating a region of your screen, such as might be used for screen-captures or other kinds of presentation.

It can provide a plain whiteboard for drawing, or a transparent window (on OS installations that support this) so that existing windows can be annotated/highlighted, using either solid or transluscent "pens".

(I would have used Ardesia, but it doesn't work on my system...)
